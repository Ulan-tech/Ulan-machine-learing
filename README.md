# ML model for classification of parts before metal 3D printing
- The optimized classification model will enable users to assess their designs for 3D printability at the early design stage.
- Different ML models are used. 
- For now random forest feature importance has been completed. 

# Future work:
- Xgboost will be utilized
- More data will be supplied 
- The model will be used as website or GUI (production)
